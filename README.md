Example

Linear Function
	- Linear function with error offset at each point.
	- Neural network with mean squared error loss
	- Layers:
		* 1-5 Sigmoid
		* 5-5 Sigmoid
		* 5-1 Linear
	- 4-fold cross validation

Quadratic Function
	- Quadratic function with error offset at each point.
	- Neural network with mean squared error loss
	- Layers:
		* 1-5 Sigmoid
		* 5-5 Sigmoid
		* 5-1 Linear
	- 5-fold cross validation
